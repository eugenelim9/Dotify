# HW3 - Fragments, Activity Lifecycle & Rotation by Eugene Lim

This is a spotify clone that loads a list of songs. When a song is clicked, a miniplayer appears at the bottom where a button will shuffle the songs and if the miniplayer is clicked then it will open that song to a player.<br/>
<br/>
This player will show the song's name, artist and cover image. On the top right of player there will be a settings button. Click to see profile, statistics and about.<br/>
<br/>
Changing orientation of the phone at the player will keep the play count. Changing orientation of the phone at the songs list will keep the mini player visible.

## Extra credit: Attempted
1. Every Fragment (other than SettingsFragment) has a Up/back button in the top right corner. Clicking
will take you back to the previous fragment (+.25)
2. Instead of Settings <Button> in your layout from requirement #1, make a Settings "Action Button‚Äù in
the app bar (header bar at the top). https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/actions (+.25)
